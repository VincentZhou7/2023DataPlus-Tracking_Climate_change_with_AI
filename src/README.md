This repo is composed of three folders. 

To the folder data_preprocessing, it extracts data from the geojson files 
To the folder fine_tuning, it finetunes the CLIP model with our own dataset extracted from the folder data_preprocessing to get better performance on climate-related remote sensing data.
To the folder model_performace, it is used to test the performance of original CLIP and tuned CLIP on EuroSAT dataset.
